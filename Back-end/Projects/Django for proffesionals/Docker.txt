## for somereason for docker to work it the project app should be hosted in another directory, for instance:
---for instance the project folder will be called 'ch1-docker'
Django for proffesionals\ch1-docker\

[SET UP Docker]
• install pipenv & Django
•
• create a folder and then create your project/app in it
---for instance the project will be called 'ch1-docker'

$ docker run hello-world - download an official Docker image and then run it within a container
$ docker info - info
• configure Dockerfile in \ProjectFolder
• create and configure docker-compose.yml \rojectFolder
$ docker build . - indicates the current directory is where to execute the command
$ docker-compose up - run Docker container (to confirm it worked go to => http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

or
$ docker-compose up -d # Detached mode doesnt show us the server docker log
$ docker-compose logs # to see logs
 
$ docker-compose down # stop running Docker container


• after using $ docker-compose up # we will enter commands in this format $ docker-compose exec web EnterCommand 
for instance:
$ docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
