    Bug-Fixes(IMPORTANT):
        Changed => after signing in at auth/jwt/create/ url the user is still not authenticated!!! (backend) (JWT Authentication bug), therefore switched to token + session Authentication (dj_rest_auth + rest_framework.authtoken ) instead of JWT (djoser.urls.jwt). [check config/urls.py]
        Need To Be Done =>. because of the switch to token & session Authentication, update the front-end post requests urls (at actions/auth.js) (new url endpoints are descripted at config/urls.py)
    
    config:
        1. Set up email settings at config/settings.py

    accounts:
        1. Set users id to uuid at accounts/models.py
        2. accounts/admin.py is empty fill it up!  
        
    
front-end:
    Bug-Fixes:
        1. if the page refresh after logout, the user get logged in
        2. when an authenticated user visit the login page the page renders the guest nav bar for a second
